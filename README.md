Welcome to the Tennis Video Analyzer and Tracker project! This tool is designed to transform a simple video of a tennis rally into a comprehensive analysis of player and ball dynamics. By detecting and tracking players and the ball, this project provides insights into court positioning, movement speeds, and overall game performance. Not only is it a powerful analytical tool, but it was also incredibly fun to build. From fine-tuning player detection to taming an elusive ball tracker, every step was a blend of technical challenges and rewarding breakthroughs. Whether you're a coach, player, or just an enthusiast, this project offers a unique perspective on the beautiful game of tennis.

### What Did I LEARN?

##Eye for Detail (Computer Vision)##: Got my hands dirty with detecting and tracking players and that cheeky tennis ball in video feeds using fancy models and techniques.
##Model Whisperer (Machine Learning)##: Juggled custom and open-source models for tasks like player detection, ball tracking, and keypoint spotting like a pro.
##Data Ninja (Data Processing and Analysis)##: Mastered the art of processing video data, filling in the blanks, and crunching numbers to analyze positions and speeds.
##Python Prodigy (Python Programming)##: Leveled up my Python skills with a little help from OpenCV, TensorFlow, and a sprinkle of custom algorithms.
##Algorithm Alchemist (Algorithm Development)##: Cooked up algorithms for filtering, selecting relevant data, converting perspectives, and calculating speedsâ€”essentially, turning data into magic.

These skills are now part of my toolkit, ready to tackle challenge and beyond!

### Challenges to Address and Next Steps if I ever revisit this project

While the Tennis Video Analyzer and Tracker has come a long way, there are still a few challenges to tackle and exciting avenues for future improvements:

##### Enhanced Ball Tracking Accuracy:

##Challenge##: The ball tracking model occasionally loses track of the ball, especially during fast rallies or occlusions.
##Next Steps##: Currently, I addressed this through extrapolation but I could incorporate more robust tracking algorithms, such as those leveraging deep learning techniques or combining multiple tracking models for increased accuracy.

##### Distinguishing Players Automatically:

##Challenge##: The current model sometimes struggles to consistently identify and distinguish between players.
##Next Steps##: Implement advanced player identification methods, possibly using player-specific features or uniforms, to ensure consistent and accurate tracking.

##### Real-Time Processing:

##Challenge##: The current implementation processes videos offline, which limits its use for live game analysis.
##Next Steps##: Optimize the code for real-time processing, enabling coaches and analysts to get instant feedback during matches.

### What are the steps I took to build this project?

#### 1. Player Detection (and a Few Extras)

First things first, I need to detect the players. However, the model initially wanted to be too inclusive, tagging ball boys, spectators, and perhaps even a stray pigeon.

#### 2. Ball Tracking (A.K.A. The Vanishing Ball Act)

Next, Itackle the elusive ball using an open-source ball tracking model. Think of it as a game of hide-and-seek where the ball loves to disappear and reappear unpredictably. The results are quite erratic as you can clearly see...

#### 3. Court Keypoint Detection (Home-Grown Accuracy)

![Court Keypoint Detection](/images/output_video_3_court_keypoints.gif)
To make sense of everything, I detect key points on the court using a custom machine learning model. This step ensures we have a reliable reference for the ball and player positions, making the next steps smoother. Now I can fix the blantant issues with the ball and player tracking from the previous stages.

#### 4. Ball Position Extrapolation (Filling in the Blanks)

![Ball Position Extrapolation](/images/output_video_4_better_ball_detection.gif)
Given the ball's tendency to disappear, I extrapolate its position from known frames. It's like connecting the dots, but for a high-speed tennis ball. This improves our ball tracking accuracy significantly.

#### 5. Player Selection (Keeping It Relevant)

To avoid distractions, I filter out everyone except the players closest to the court's keypoints. This ensures our analysis is focused on the actual game and not the enthusiastic fans.

#### 6. Top-Down View Conversion (Bird's Eye View)

![Top-Down View Conversion](/images/output_video_6_mini_court_display.gif)
Using the court's keypoints and the players' heights, I convert the ball's position to a top-down view. It's like giving a drone's perspective on the match, providing a clearer understanding of movements and positions.

#### 7. Speed Tracking (Game, Set, Match!)

![Final Model](/images/output_video_FINAL.gif)
Finally, I calculate the speed of both the players and the ball throughout the video. This data provides valuable insights into the players' agility and the ball's dynamics, rounding off our analysis.
